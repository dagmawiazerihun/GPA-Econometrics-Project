    "# GPA Predictor Project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors:** Dagmawi Zerihun, Khushi Mohapatra  \n",
    "**Institution:** Denison University, Department of Economics  \n",
    "**Course:** ECON 307-01 - Intro to Econometrics  \n",
    "**Instructor:** Dr. Ngwunui Azenui  \n",
    "**Date:** May 5, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict college GPA (COLLGPA) using various independent variables that reflect a student's background, habits, and activities. The project leverages econometric methods to identify the most significant predictors of college GPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **COLLGPA:** Overall college grade point average (Dependent Variable)\n",
    "- **SAT:** Aggregate math and critical reading SAT score\n",
    "- **HSGPA:** Overall high school grade point average\n",
    "- **SAT_HSGPA:** Interaction term between SAT score and high school GPA\n",
    "- **HRSTD:** Average number of hours spent studying per week\n",
    "- **HRSTD_SQ:** Squared term of hours spent studying per week\n",
    "- **HREXTRA:** Average number of hours spent in extracurricular activities per week\n",
    "- **DOUBLE:** Dummy variable indicating if the student is pursuing a double major\n",
    "- **FEMALE:** Dummy variable indicating if the student is female\n",
    "- **SLEEP:** Average hours of sleep per week\n",
    "- **INTERNATIONAL:** Dummy variable indicating if the student is an international student\n",
    "- **INTERNATIONAL_DOUBLE:** Interaction term between being an international student and having a double major\n",
    "- **SCHOLAR:** Dummy variable indicating if the student has received scholarship money\n",
    "- **GREEK:** Dummy variable indicating if the student is affiliated with Greek life\n",
    "- **DRINK:** Average number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week\n",
    "- **GREEK_DRINK:** Interaction term between Greek affiliation and the average number of alcoholic drinks per week\n",
    "- **ATHLETE:** Dummy variable indicating if the student is an intercollegiate athlete\n",
    "- **FRIEND:** Percentage of time spent with a significant other while in college\n",
    "- **DECISION:** Dummy variable indicating if the student applied to Denison using Early Decision\n",
    "- **DECISION_SCHOLAR:** Interaction term between applying Early Decision and having received scholarship money\n",
    "- **HELP:** Average number of hours per week spent obtaining help outside of class\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Specifications\n",
    "### Model 1\n",
    "Initial regression model with the following equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{COLLGPA} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{SAT} + \\beta_2 \\text{HSGPA} + \\beta_3 \\text{SAT} \\times \\text{HSGPA} + \\ldots + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 2\n",
    "Adjusted model after addressing multicollinearity and transforming some variables:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{COLLGPA} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{SAT} + \\beta_2 \\text{HSGPA} + \\beta_3 \\ln(\\text{HRSTD}) + \\ldots + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 3\n",
    "Final model with additional modifications to improve fit and significance:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{COLLGPA} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{SAT} + \\beta_2 \\text{HSGPA} + \\beta_3 \\ln(\\text{HRSTD}) + \\beta_4 \\ln(\\text{HREXTRA}) + \\ldots + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- The final model explains 33.23% of the variation in college GPA.\n",
    "- Significant predictors include SAT score, high school GPA, hours studied, and scholarship status.\n",
    "- Interaction terms such as SAT \\times HSGPA and GREEK \\times DRINK provide additional insights into the relationships between variables and college GPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 3 is identified as the best model for predicting college GPA, with most variables being statistically significant and an improved overall fit. Future work can explore additional variables or alternative models to further enhance predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
